# Agent orchestration

kata is a tracker, not an orchestrator: it does not create worktrees, launch
coding agents, or supervise processes. What it provides is a durable board and a
small metadata convention that external tools use to coordinate agents around a
shared issue. This chapter is the operational recipe for that convention.

The boundary is intentional. kata stores issue state, metadata, relationships,
and events; launchers own worktrees, terminals, process supervision, and branch
lifecycle. If a dashboard needs mechanical lifecycle state such as
running/orphaned/done, it should read that from the launcher or harness, not from
kata metadata. If a delegated issue tree is useful, model it with ordinary issue
relationships such as `--parent`; there is no separate delegated-link type.

The coordination substrate is the `work.*` metadata convention documented in the
[Metadata reference](../reference/metadata.md#orchestration-conventions-work-keys):

- `work.branch`: the git branch doing the work.
- `work.attention`: `ok | needs-human | stuck`, the live signal about whether a
  human is wanted.
- `work.attention_msg`: a one-line current-state message.

All names below are neutral placeholders: `spoke-project` is the kata project,
`agent-a` an actor, and `hub.example` / `daemon.example` daemon hosts.

Contract injection and attention tracking serve different purposes.
`kata agent-contract-hook` emits the canonical Codex context directly; optional
`--source ./agent-prompt.txt` replaces it with a local UTF-8 prompt file. A
relative source stays within the current directory: `..` paths and symlink
targets that escape it fail. Absolute paths use the specified file. A missing
file falls back to the default, while an empty file supplies an empty prompt.
The native multi-harness contract form accepts the same option.
`kata attention-hook start|end` only tracks lifecycle metadata and has no
prompt-source option. Daemon event hooks in `hooks.toml` are independent of both.

## Roles

**Launcher.** The tool that starts a coding-agent session. It creates the
tracking issue, stamps `work.branch` with the branch it checked out for the
session, and installs the harness hooks that keep attention truthful. It owns
`work.branch`. Commands: `kata create --meta work.branch=...`, `kata meta set
<ref> work.branch ...`.

**Working agent.** The coding agent running in the worktree. It signals its own
live state on the issue by writing the attention pair for mid-session events:
raising `stuck` when it cannot proceed, `needs-human` when it wants review, and
clearing back to `ok`. Commands: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention ...`.

**Coordinator.** A delegating agent or a human dashboard that follows one or more
tracking issues and reacts when they need attention or close. It reads, it does
not write `work.*`. Commands: `kata wait`, `kata list --meta work.attention=...`,
`kata events --tail`.

**Merge pipeline.** The pipeline that verifies finished work and closes the
tracking issue with evidence. It reads `work.branch` to know what to merge and
closes the issue; it does not reset `work.*`. Commands: `kata show <ref>`,
`kata close <ref> --done --commit <sha>`.

## Launch: create the tracking issue

The launcher creates one tracking issue per agent session and binds the branch at
creation. Use an idempotency key so a retried launch does not create a duplicate
issue:

```sh
kata create "implement widget export" \
  --meta work.branch=agent/widget-export \
  --idempotency-key launch-agent-a-widget-export
```

`--meta` takes string values only, which is all `work.branch` needs. Capture the
returned issue ref (for example `abc4`) and launch `agent-a` on the
`agent/widget-export` branch. If the launcher must set the branch after creation
(because it created the issue before checking out), `kata meta set abc4
work.branch agent/widget-export` is equivalent and safe to retry.

## Keep attention truthful with hooks

To load the contract in every session, use
[`kata agent-hook install --all`](../workflows/agents.md#contract-in-every-session).
The [agent-hook reference](../reference/cli.md#agent-hook) covers user contract
hooks and attention bundles in user or project scope. Add `--attention` to the
installer; the launcher must provide the tracked issue in `KATA_REF`.

The recommended default is **not** to rely on the agent remembering to update
attention. Agents forget to clear or raise it, and an issue stuck at a stale
`ok` is worse than no signal. Instead the launcher installs harness hooks so the
attention pair reflects reality even when the agent says nothing.

Wire two launcher-installed hooks around the session. These are generic shell
hooks, a "session-start hook" and a "stop/idle hook" that run a command; any
coding-agent harness that can run a command at those points works.

Session-start hook: mark the issue in-progress and healthy.

```sh
# runs when the agent session starts
kata meta set "$KATA_REF" work.attention ok
```

Stop/idle hook: if the session ends and the agent never cleared to a terminal
state, raise `needs-human` so the issue does not silently go quiet.

```sh
# runs when the agent session stops or goes idle
current=$(kata meta get "$KATA_REF" work.attention --json | jq -r '.value')
if [ "$current" = "ok" ]; then
  kata meta set "$KATA_REF" work.attention needs-human
  kata meta set "$KATA_REF" work.attention_msg "session ended without hand-off"
fi
```

(`$KATA_REF` here is whatever the launcher passes into the hook environment as the
tracking issue ref.)

On top of that default wiring, the agent itself does direct self-assertion for
**mid-session** signals the hooks cannot see; it knows it is stuck long before
the session stops:

```sh
kata meta set abc4 work.attention stuck
kata meta set abc4 work.attention_msg "auth library has no async API; need a decision"
```

Hooks and self-assertion are complementary: hooks are the floor that guarantees a
truthful terminal signal, self-assertion is the finer-grained live signal. Both
write the same two keys, and because attention is last-write-wins by design,
whichever fired most recently is the state coordinators see.

For Claude Code workspaces, `kata init --with-hooks` additively installs two
command hooks in `.claude/settings.json`: `SessionStart` runs
`kata attention-hook start` for new, resumed, and cleared sessions (but not
context compaction), and `SessionEnd` runs `kata attention-hook end` only for
terminal exits rather than clear/resume transitions.
Both use the launcher-provided `KATA_REF` and intentionally do nothing when it
is absent. The hook logic lives in the installed `kata` binary, so the approved
command does not delegate to a repository script whose contents can
change independently. Re-running the command is a no-op, and symlinked
`.claude` or `settings.json` paths are refused. Kit's shared agent-hook manager
owns the additive config mutation and preserves unrelated hook entries.

For Codex CLI workspaces, `kata init --with-codex-hooks` installs attention and,
when needed, contract `SessionStart` hooks in `.codex/hooks.json`. The contract hook injects the
canonical marker-free agent briefing through `kata agent-contract-hook`
on startup, resume, clear, and context compaction. The attention hook runs
`kata attention-hook start` on startup, resume, and clear, but not
compaction, using the same launcher-provided
`KATA_REF` and command as the Claude Code wiring. Codex prompts to
trust project-layer hooks the first time it loads them, so expect one
interactive confirmation on first run. Re-running the command is a no-op, and
symlinked `.codex` or `hooks.json` paths are refused; if `.codex/config.toml`
already defines a `[hooks]` table, the command prints a non-fatal warning that
Codex loads both files' hooks together.

When a user contract hook already supplies the briefing, init skips the workspace
contract and removes an untracked duplicate. Tracked workspace hook files keep
both hooks for teammates without a user hook. The normal attention entry keeps
its trust key; init warns when removing a duplicate shifts surviving hooks and
requires re-trust through `/hooks`. If the user hook is removed, re-run init to restore workspace
contract injection. See the [init reference](../reference/cli.md#workspace-initialization) for
ownership, config selection, and the tracked-file exception.

The Codex init flag now installs `kata attention-hook end` on genuine native
SessionEnd. Existing start commands retain their trust identities. For
session-aware ownership fencing, use `kata agent-hook install codex --scope
project --attention` or `kata init --with-agent-hooks codex`.

Older runtimes and targets without native terminal events need launcher
cleanup. Use one tracked session per issue with the compatible bare-hook
wrapper. Run cleanup synchronously in an `EXIT` trap and propagate the agent's
exit status. Native hook failures stay silent; abrupt launcher death cannot
execute a trap. Amp, OpenCode and ZCode can supply their native start half;
Antigravity needs launcher start as well. For example:
```sh
export KATA_REF=abc4
kata attention-hook start
trap 'status=$?; kata attention-hook end; exit "$status"' EXIT
codex ...
```

## Coordinate: wait and dashboards

A delegating **coordinator** joins on sub-tasks with `kata wait`. Launch two
sub-tasks, then block until either needs attention:

```sh
# fan out (--json output carries the new ref at .issue.short_id)
a=$(kata create "port the parser"  --meta work.branch=agent/parser \
      --idempotency-key sub-parser  --json | jq -r '.issue.short_id')
b=$(kata create "port the emitter" --meta work.branch=agent/emitter \
      --idempotency-key sub-emitter --json | jq -r '.issue.short_id')
# ... launch agents on those branches ...

# join: return as soon as either sub-task needs a human or closes
kata wait "$a" "$b" --until attention --any
```

`--until attention` matches either `needs-human` or `stuck`, and in the attention
modes a *close* also completes the wait; the reported reason distinguishes a
close from an attention change, so the coordinator can branch on it. Default
`--until closed` with default `--all` blocks until every named issue is closed;
`--timeout <dur>` exits with a dedicated nonzero code so a wrapper can tell a
timeout from a satisfied wait. The timeout is the wall-clock budget for the
whole command, including project/ref resolution and polling. `kata wait` is
read-only state polling (default `--poll-interval 2s`).

For a **human dashboard**, poll the same convention with `list`, or follow the
event stream:

```sh
kata list --meta work.attention=needs-human
kata list --meta work.attention=stuck
kata events --tail
```

`kata list --meta` is scoped to the selected project. A dashboard that spans
projects should either poll each project separately or follow the event stream
and maintain its own cross-project view.

The `issue.metadata_updated` events carry per-key before/after diffs, so a
dashboard sees exactly when an attention level changes.

## Merge: verify and close

Merge pipeline reads `work.branch` to know what to integrate, verifies the
work, and closes the tracking issue with typed evidence:

```sh
branch=$(kata meta get abc4 work.branch --json | jq -r '.value')   # "agent/widget-export"
# ... merge and verify the branch ...
kata close abc4 --done \
  --message "Merged widget export; export round-trips and unit tests pass." \
  --commit <sha>
```

Closing does not reset metadata. The closed issue may still carry
`work.attention=needs-human` from before the merge; that is expected. Consumers
ignore `work.*` on closed issues: the close itself is the terminal signal, not
the attention value.

## Failure modes

**Agent dies without clearing attention.** If the agent crashes or the session is
killed mid-task, it never writes a terminal signal. The launcher-installed
stop/idle hook covers this: it fires on session end and raises `needs-human`, so
the issue surfaces on the dashboard instead of sitting at a stale `ok`. This is
the main reason hooks are the recommended default rather than agent
self-assertion alone.

**Stale `work.branch` after force-push or rebase.** kata never validates
`work.branch` against a repository, so a rewritten or deleted branch leaves the
value pointing at history that no longer exists. This is informational only;
kata cannot detect it. Merge pipeline should treat `work.branch` as a hint and
verify the branch still resolves before acting on it.

**Two agents on one tracking issue.** The ownership convention is one
working-agent side per issue. If two agents write `work.attention` on the same
issue, their last-write-wins updates trample each other and the signal becomes
meaningless. kata does not prevent this. Detect it from the event stream: the
`issue.metadata_updated` events name the actor, so two distinct actors writing
`work.attention` on one issue is the tell. Fix the launcher wiring so each
session gets its own tracking issue.

## Adopting in your repo

The fastest way to adopt the `work.*` convention is to paste a short contract
into the repo's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` so every agent that touches the board
follows the same protocol. The same snippet also works ad hoc: drop it into a
session prompt when a repo has not adopted it yet, and the agent will honor the
convention for that session. The draft below is deliberate, reference-grade
prose; paste it essentially intact.

```markdown
## Kata `work.*` conventions (agent orchestration)

This repo's kata board uses the `work.*` metadata contract; see kata's
<https://katatracker.com/docs/operations/agent-orchestration/> for the full
recipe.

**When you work a kata-tracked issue:**

- When you claim or start a kata issue, immediately mark it actively tracked:
  `kata meta set <ref> work.attention ok`. This makes in-flight work visible
  to coordinators and dashboards from the moment it is grabbed.
- If the work happens on a dedicated branch, stamp it once:
  `kata meta set <ref> work.branch <branch>` (or bind at creation:
  `kata create ... --meta work.branch=<branch> --idempotency-key <key>`).
- Keep your live state truthful on the issue:
  `kata meta set <ref> work.attention stuck|needs-human|ok`, with a one-line
  `kata meta set <ref> work.attention_msg "<why>"`. Raise `stuck` when you
  cannot proceed, `needs-human` when you want input or review (you may keep
  working), and clear back to `ok` when unblocked.
- Never end a session with the signal stale: before stopping, either close
  the issue or set the attention pair to reflect the hand-off.

**When you delegate work as separate kata issues (fan-out/join):**

- Create each sub-issue with `--meta work.branch=...` and an idempotency key;
  capture refs from `--json` (`.issue.short_id`).
- Join with `kata wait <refs> --until attention --any` (matches `needs-human`
  or `stuck`; a close also completes the wait, and the reported reason
  distinguishes which). Use `--timeout` so a wrapper can tell timeout from
  satisfaction. As coordinator you read `work.*`; you never write it on
  issues you delegated.

**Always:** one writer per key; `work.*` on closed issues is meaningless, so
never write it there and ignore it when reading.
```

Instructions produce tendency, not contract: an agent may still forget to raise
`needs-human` or clear a stale `ok`. For a reliability floor, pair the snippet
with the launcher-installed hooks described earlier in this chapter, which keep
the terminal attention signal truthful even when the agent says nothing.
